            <p>Currently in my free time I enjoy to do a variety of things but the majority of them revolve around the outdoors. Now that I live on a lake I just learned to wakesurf and wakeboard I try to spend as much time as possible on the water doing that as well as tubing with friends. I like to hang with friends camping, going hiking, and having bonfires. Its also nice to lay in the hammock and read a good book all day long relaxing doing nothing.</p>
