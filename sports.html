            <p>Over the course of my life I have played many different sports. I still enjoy playing them to this day. I enjoy playing baseball, tennis, hockey, golf, and soccer. During high school I played varsity baseball and tennis. I currently still play beer league hockey once a week and club tennis.  I also enjoy watching professional sports as well. I cheer for the Detroit Red Wings in hockey, Detroit Tigers for baseball, and Barcelona in soccer.</p>
