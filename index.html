        <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
        <p>Hi! I am Nick Zeitter and this is my site for assignment 1, README.
          For some content I will post a short little bio about myself.
          I am from Grand Rapids, about an hour west of East Lansing. I am a senior
          in Media and Information with a minor in IT. I currently work as a Project
          Management Intern at Delta Dental in Okemos. I like playing hockey, baseball,
          tennis, golf, and soccer. A few things I like to do in my spare time besides
          those sports would be wakeboarding, wakesurfing, enjoying the outdoors, and anything
          on the water. I have one sibling, a sister who is shown in the picture below.</p>
