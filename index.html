            <p>Hi! I am Nick Zeitter and this is my site for assignment 1, README.
              For some content I will post a short little bio about myself.
              I am from Grand Rapids, about an hour west of East Lansing. I am a senior
              in Media and Information with a minor in IT. I currently work as a Project
              Management Intern at Delta Dental in Okemos. I like playing hockey, baseball,
              tennis, golf, and soccer. A few things I like to do in my spare time besides
              those sports would be wakeboarding, wakesurfing, enjoying the outdoors, and anything
              on the water. I have one sibling, a sister who is shown in the picture below.</p>
