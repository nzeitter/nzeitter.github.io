            <p>I have traveled out of the country a few times and they have been some of the best times of my life. I went to Cabo San Lucas Mexico for my sisters spring break in 2009 and it had some of the best weather I had ever enjoyed for a week straight. We were able to go snorkeling, deep sea fishing, and explore the town among other things. For my senior spring break in 2012 I went to Negril Jamaica with some of my closest friends. Everyday it was 87 degrees, sunny with a couple clouds in the sky, and a slight breeze everyday for 7 days straight. We were able to go cliff diving, boat ride excursions, and exploring the city areas. By far the most fun thing was cliff diving at RickÕs cafŽ at the highest heights.
